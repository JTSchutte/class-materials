<h1 id="geography-485l585l-milestones"><a href="#geography-485l585l-milestones">Geography 485L/585L Milestones</a></h1>
<p>These <em>milestone</em> assignments will be compiled into an online, web-based <em>portfolio</em> that you will develop over the course of the semester. This portfolio will include a &quot;home page&quot; (started in the second week's milestone) that includes links to all of the created milestone and <a href="../deep-dives/deep-dives.html">&quot;deep dive&quot;</a> pages that you will create.</p>
<h2 id="week-1---creating-your-first-web-page-in-github"><a href="#week-1---creating-your-first-web-page-in-github">Week 1 - Creating your first web page in GitHub</a></h2>
<p>Developing content to go onto the web has evolved from a solitary effort to one where teams work together in developing components of larger web sites. These teams need to have a variety of tools to enable their work. Some of the most important tools enable code sharing with the team, and in projects based on the <a href="http://opensource.org/osd-annotated">Open Source</a> software model the rest of the world. The <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> web platform uses the <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> distributed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control">version control</a> system to enable sharing of code and hosting static web pages based on that shared code.</p>
<p>We will be using GitHub as the platform for hosting your portfolios for the class, allowing you to learn how version control operates, and how to provide comments and keep notes on your work and the work of others (this will be part of our peer review process).</p>
<p>While the work we do this and next week will be directly through the editor integrated into the GitHub system, you will eventually want to install one of the recommended desktop applications that allow you to develop your web pages on your local computer and then update the files on the GitHub system when you want to create a new version. Also, you can't add things like images to your web pages until you are adding them to a local repository on your computer and then sending them to GitHub.</p>

<h2 id="week-2---create-a-more-complex-web-page-and-style-it"><a href="#week-2---create-a-more-complex-web-page-and-style-it">Week 2 - Create a More Complex Web Page and Style It</a></h2>
<p>This week’s milestone activity takes you through the process of creating two more web pages in preparation for next week’s work with the Google Maps API in developing your first web mapping page. These pages will be:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A <em>home page</em> for your portfolio that will be the access point for all of the materials you create (<a href="../examples/homePageTemplate.html">template</a>), and</li>
<li>Your first web page containing materials related to a <em>milestone</em> assignment (<a href="../examples/assignmentTemplate.html">template</a>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Open the <em>milestone</em> assignment template linked above and select &quot;view Source&quot; from the browser's menu to view the source code for the file. Create a new document in your GitHub <code>gh-pages</code> branch named <code>milestone_02.html</code>, copy the page code from the &quot;view source&quot;, and paste it into your <code>milestone_02.html</code> document. Add your responses to the following questions to the <code>milestone_02.html</code> document.</p>
<p>Open the <em>home page</em> template linked above in your web browser and select “view source” from the browser’s menu to examine the source code for the page.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Question 1</dt>
<dd>From examining the display in your web browser and the structure of the source code in the page, what effect (if any) does the white space (i.e. tabs, blank lines, multiple spaces) have on what is displayed in the browser?
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Question 2 : How are the</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;h1&gt;</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;h2&gt; </code></pre>
<p>elements from the source code displayed differently in the browser?</p>
<dl>
<dt>Question 3</dt>
<dd>What type of element would you use to create additional list elements in either the “topic” or “data type” lists on the page.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Log into your GitHub account, and create a new document in the <code>gh-pages</code> branch and name it <code>index.html</code>.</p>
<p>Copy the source code from the “view source” information for the web page you opened in 1) above and paste it into <code>index.html</code> document in the GitHub editor. Save your changes</p>
<p>Test your new page by trying the following web addresse (it may take a few minutes for your newly created page to become available):</p>
<pre><code>    http://&lt;your GitHub username&gt;.github.io/&lt;your repository name&gt;
    
    http://&lt;your GitHub username&gt;.github.io/&lt;your repository name&gt;/index.html</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>&lt;your GitHub username&gt;</code> is replaced by your username for GitHub, and <code>&lt;your repository name&gt;</code> is replaced with the name of the repository that you created your <code>helloworld.html</code> document in during last week's milestone exercise.</p>
<p>The reason that the first web address works (without specifying the file name) is that if a file name is not provided in a web address, many web servers will deliver a file named “index.html” if it is found in the requested directory.</p>
<p>Flesh out (using using the GitHub <em>edit</em> function) the <code>index.html</code> page that you created above with information specific to you based upon the content areas in the page. Add a link to your <code>milestone_02.html</code> file to the &quot;milestones&quot; section of your <code>index.html</code> page.</p>
<p>Make a copy of your <code>index.html</code> page by copying the content of the page and pasting it into a new document named <code>index_styled.html</code>.</p>
<p>Experiment with some of the styling capabilities described in Dave Raggett’s “Adding a Touch of Style” page (<a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/Style.html">http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/Style.html</a>) on <code>index_styled.html</code> page you created above. Make at least three stylistic changes to the <code>index_styled.html</code> page.</p>
<h2 id="week-3---creation-of-a-web-page-with-an-embedded-google-map"><a href="#week-3---creation-of-a-web-page-with-an-embedded-google-map">Week 3 - Creation of a Web Page with an Embedded Google Map</a></h2>
<p>In preparation for creating a web page with an embedded Google Map you should first answer the following questions about what and how you want to map. As you define the type of map you want to build, think about a specific problem or topic that you would like to address with your map.</p>
<p>In this exercise you will be generating the configuration for the base map (i.e. The Google Maps background layers). In future assignments you will add your own custom content to free-standing web pages that include a mapper based upon the base map you define here.</p>
<p>Create a web page (based upon the assignment <a href="../examples/assignmentTemplate.html">template</a>) that contains your milestone writeup (including the embedded Google Map required by question 5), and link it to the home page (<code>index.html</code>) file you created last week.</p>
<p>Respond to Question 1-4 with an understanding that you are generating a web page that is publicly accessible, and should be both clear and complete.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Question 1</dt>
<dd><p>What area do you want to depict in your map? Why?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Question 2</dt>
<dd><p>What is the center point (latitude and longitude) of your area of interest?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Question 3</dt>
<dd><p>What style of map (roads, satellite, hybrid, terrain) is appropriate for your map? Why?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Question 4</dt>
<dd><p>What is the scale of your map (local, regional, continental, global)? How will this translate into your selection of an appropriate default zoom level for your map?</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now that you have answered these questions about the map that you want to create, refer to the examples in the lecture notes, the Google Maps Tutorial (http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial.html), and this week's reading assignment to create a custom Google map.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Question 5</dt>
<dd>Embed a Google Map in your writeup that is based upon your responses to questions 1-4 above.
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="week-4---styling-of-an-embedded-google-map"><a href="#week-4---styling-of-an-embedded-google-map">Week 4 - Styling of an Embedded Google Map</a></h2>
<p>Make a free-standing web page based upon the Google Map that you created as part of last week's lab assignment. Use the Google <a href="http://gmaps-samples-v3.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/styledmaps/wizard/index.html">styled maps wizard</a> to define <em>at least</em> three modified base map styles and integrate the JSON generated by the wizard into your new Google Map page.</p>
<h2 id="week-5---proj4-gdal-and-ogr"><a href="#week-5---proj4-gdal-and-ogr">Week 5 - Proj4, GDAL, and OGR</a></h2>
<p>This week's milestone concentrates on some command line tools that are useful in working with raster and vector data sets. These tools should be available on your personal computers (through the installation of the FW-Tools package for Windows (use the <a href="http://fwtools.loskot.net/"><em>mirror site</em></a> from the FW-Tools website to download the &quot;FWTools247.exe&quot; package to install on your system), or the GDAL, OGR, and Proj4 frameworks on the Mac)</p>

<p>As with the previous milestones, please link your web page with your writeup from your homepage in GitHub.</p>
<p>There are a large number of WMS services available on the web. One way to find interesting services is to search for them using standard search engines such as Google. Try searching for the following search phrase:</p>
<p><code>“REQUEST=GetCapabilities” and “SERVICE=WMS”</code></p>
<p>as a single search phrase</p>
<dl>
<dt>Question 1</dt>
<dd><p>What search engine did you use?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Question 2</dt>
<dd><p>How many ‘hits’ did you get?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Question 3</dt>
<dd><p>How useful (generally in terms of getting a pointers to live WMS services [defined as a functioning GetCapabilities request]) were the ‘hits’?</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Pick two of the services that included live &quot;GetCapabilities&quot; requests that you found above, and answer the following questions about each.</p>
<dl>

<p>For example, a WMS request for a 200x200 pixel PNG file for an area surrounding Bernalillo County (-107.2,34.7,-106,35.25) from the previous lab would be (<a href="http://gstore.unm.edu/apps/rgis/datasets/92403ebf-aec5-404b-ae8a-6db41f388737/services/ogc/wms?VERSION=1.1.1&amp;SERVICE=WMS&amp;REQUEST=GetMap&amp;BBOX=-107.2,34.7,-106,35.25&amp;LAYERS=2007fe_35_county00&amp;FORMAT=image/png&amp;TRANSPARENT=TRUE&amp;STYLES=&amp;SRS=EPSG:4326&amp;WIDTH=200&amp;HEIGHT=200">link</a>):</p>
<pre><code>http://gstore.unm.edu/apps/rgis/datasets/92403ebf-aec5-404b-ae8a-6db41f388737/
services/ogc/wms?VERSION=1.1.1&amp;SERVICE=WMS&amp;REQUEST=GetMap&amp;BBOX=-107.2,34.7,-106,35.25&amp;
LAYERS=2007fe_35_county00&amp;FORMAT=image/png&amp;TRANSPARENT=TRUE&amp;STYLES=&amp;
SRS=EPSG:4326&amp;WIDTH=200&amp;HEIGHT=200</code></pre>
<p><img src="images/bernalillo_01.png" />  </p>
<p>this request results in a map image that does not agree with the standard shape of Bernalillo county (depicted in the Google Map below) that we are accustomed to, regardless of the specific map projection being used.</p>
<p><img src="images/bernalillo_county_-_Google_Maps.png" />  </p>
<p>This discrepancy is the result of a difference in the aspect ratio of the requested BBOX (-107.2,34.7,-106,35.25) and the requested image dimensions (200x200 pixels). <em>When you compose a WMS GetMap request, you need to make sure that the aspect ratio of both the image size and BBOX match.</em></p>
<p>For example, if we calculate the aspect ratio of the BBOX we obtain the following values (remember that the BBOX is specified as a comma separated list of x,y coordinates: minx,miny,maxx,maxy):</p>
<pre><code>BBOX width = (maxx) - (minx) = (-106) - (-107.2) = 1.2 degrees
BBOX height = (maxy) - (miny) = (35.25) - (34.7) = 0.55 degrees
BBOX aspect ratio = (BBOX width) / (BBOX height) = (1.2) / (0.55) = 2.1818</code></pre>
<p>If we want to retrieve a map image that is 200 pixels wide, we need to calculate an image height that yields an aspect ratio that matches the BBOX aspect ratio. Harking back to basic algebra:</p>
<pre><code>width = 200
aspect ratio = width / height = 200 / height = 2.1818
height = (width) / (aspect ratio) = 200 / 2.1818 = 91.667</code></pre>
<p>So, if we request an image that is 200x92 (we have to request pixel dimensions in integers, so rounding to the nearest integer) we should get a representation that closely approximates the proper shape of features. The modified WMS request with the new images size is the following (<a href="http://gstore.unm.edu/apps/rgis/datasets/92403ebf-aec5-404b-ae8a-6db41f388737/services/ogc/wms?VERSION=1.1.1&amp;SERVICE=WMS&amp;REQUEST=GetMap&amp;BBOX=-107.2,34.7,-106,35.25&amp;LAYERS=2007fe_35_county00&amp;FORMAT=image/png&amp;TRANSPARENT=TRUE&amp;STYLES=&amp;SRS=EPSG:4326&amp;WIDTH=200&amp;HEIGHT=92">link</a>):</p>
<pre><code>http://gstore.unm.edu/apps/rgis/datasets/92403ebf-aec5-404b-ae8a-6db41f388737/
services/ogc/wms?VERSION=1.1.1&amp;SERVICE=WMS&amp;REQUEST=GetMap&amp;BBOX=-107.2,34.7,-106,35.25&amp;
LAYERS=2007fe_35_county00&amp;FORMAT=image/png&amp;TRANSPARENT=TRUE&amp;STYLES=&amp;
SRS=EPSG:4326&amp;WIDTH=200&amp;HEIGHT=92</code></pre>
<p><img src="images/bernalillo_02.png" />  </p>
<p>This process may be reversed to request images of a fixed size for use in a client interface, with the requested BBOX modified to match the aspect ratio of the target image. If, for example, images are being requested for a client interface with a fixed map size of 600x400 pixels, a corresponding BBOX can be derived using the same calculation.</p>
<p>If, for example, the area of interest for a map is 2 degrees wide, we can calculate the target height (in degrees) using the aspect ratio of the desired image.</p>
<pre><code>image aspect ratio = (width) / (height) = (600) / (400) = 1.5
BBOX aspect ratio = (width) / (height) = (2) / (height in degrees) = 1.5
BBOX height = (width) / (BBOX aspect ratio) = (2) / (1.5) = 1.3333</code></pre>
<p>If our area of interest extends from -106 to -108 degrees East Longitude, we can use the known target height of 1.3333 to generate a WMS BBOX of the appropriate aspect ratio. If the minimum Latitude of interest is 34.7 degrees North Latitude, the maximum BBOX Y value would be</p>
<pre><code>BBOX Max Y = (BBOX Min Y) + (BBOX height) = (34.7) + (1.3333) = 36.0333</code></pre>
<p>** these RGIS links are broken at the moment **</p>
<p>This set of calculations may be used to compose the following WMS request (<a href="http://gstore.unm.edu/apps/rgis/datasets/92403ebf-aec5-404b-ae8a-6db41f388737/services/ogc/wms?VERSION=1.1.1&amp;SERVICE=WMS&amp;REQUEST=GetMap&amp;BBOX=-108,34.7,-106,36.0333&amp;LAYERS=g_2007fe_35_county00&amp;FORMAT=image/png&amp;TRANSPARENT=TRUE&amp;STYLES=&amp;SRS=EPSG:4326&amp;WIDTH=600&amp;HEIGHT=400">link</a>):</p>

<dl>
<dt>Question 6</dt>
<dd>Which layers return map images that display image content (i.e. return a non-blank image)?
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Sometimes when WMS layers are accessed, there is a limit on the map scales for which the map image will be returned. If a request is submitted for a map scale that is outside the range specified for a given layer, typically, a blank map image will be returned.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Questions 7</dt>
<dd>From examining the information for these layers in the GetCapabilities XML document - which element in each layer’s service metadata do you think provides information about the scales for which the layer will return map images containing data?
</dd>
</dl>
<p>You can effectively change the scale of a map image by changing the pixel dimensions of the requested image.</p>

<p>Following the model used in Milestone 3 for your first Google Map web page, you should first answer the following questions about what and how you want to map - <em>relating to a different focus than you have used in your previous assignments</em>. As you define the type of map you want to build, think about a specific problem or topic that you would like to address with your map.</p>
<p>In this exercise you will be generating the configuration for the base map (i.e. including one or more OpenLayer enabled background layers), adding controls, and defining an appropriate map center and zoom level for the map. You will add your own custom content (i.e. the answers to the following questions) to a free-standing web page that include an interactive mapper and the reasoning behind the design of the map.</p>
<p>Create a web page that contains your milestone assignment writeup (<em>including</em> the embedded OpenLayers map required by question 5), and link it to your home page (index.html).</p>
<p>Respond to Question 1-4 with an understanding that you are generating a web page that is publicly accessible, and should be, clear, complete, well-formatted, and reasonably styled.</p>
<p><em>Peer Review:</em> This week's assignment will include a peer review component. Specifically, 1/3 of your 20-point peer-review score will be based upon <em>your</em> peer-review of <em>two</em> other web pages generated by the students in the class.

<p>Add three WMS layers to a new map project in QGIS, with one coming from each of the following collections of WMS services.</p>
<p>Some things to keep an eye out for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any scale limits described for the various layers</li>

<p>In your write-up include the names of the layers you added, which service they came from, and screen shots (one for for each of the added layers) showing each of them in the QGIS client interface.</p>
<p>Add three WFS layers to the same QGIS project, two based upon data available from the RGIS data browser (http://rgis.unm.edu/browsedata), and one based on the USGS GeoNames WFS service (<a href="http://services.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/services/WFS/geonames/MapServer/WFSServer?request=GetCapabilities&amp;service=WFS">http://services.nationalmap.gov/arcgis/services/WFS/geonames/MapServer/WFSServer?request=GetCapabilities&amp;service=WFS</a>.   In RGIS you can see the available services for a specific data layer by</p>

<p><em>Important</em>: Before adding the GeoNames layer, you may need to go into the preferences for QGIS and under the &quot;Network&quot; options increase the &quot;Timeout for Network Requests(ms)&quot; value to a larger number than the default 60000 (1 minute) (300000 worked for me for accessing the Historic and Administrative feature types). If you don't do this, QGIS might give up on the request before it has been fulfilled by the server.</p>
