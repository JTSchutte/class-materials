<p>These <em>milestone</em> assignments will be compiled into an online, web-based <em>portfolio</em> that you will develop over the course of the semester. This portfolio will include a &quot;home page&quot; (started in the second week's milestone) that includes links to all of the created milestone and <a href="../deep-dives/deep-dives.html">&quot;deep dive&quot;</a> pages that you will create.</p>
<h2 id="week-1---creating-your-first-web-page-in-github"><a href="#week-1---creating-your-first-web-page-in-github">Week 1 - Creating your first web page in GitHub</a></h2>
<p>Developing content to go onto the web has evolved from a solitary effort to one where teams work together in developing components of larger web sites. These teams need to have a variety of tools to enable their work. Some of the most important tools enable code sharing with the team, and in projects based on the <a href="http://opensource.org/osd-annotated">Open Source</a> software model the rest of the world. The <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> web platform uses the <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> distributed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control">version control</a> system to enable sharing of code and hosting static web pages based on that shared code.</p>
<p>We will be using GitHub as the platform for hosting your portfolios for the class, allowing you to learn how version control operates, and how to provide comments and keep notes on your work and the work of others (this will be part of our peer review process).</p>
<p>While the work we do this and next week will be directly through the editor integrated into the GitHub system, you will eventually want to install one of the recommended desktop applications that allow you to develop your web pages on your local computer and then update the files on the GitHub system when you want to create a new version. Also, you can't add things like images to your web pages until you are adding them to a local repository on your computer and then sending them to GitHub.</p>
