# Geography 485L/585L Milestones #

These *milestone* assignments will be compiled into an online, web-based *portfolio* that you will develop over the course of the semester. This portfolio will include a "home page" (started in the second week's milestone) that includes links to all of the created milestone and ["deep dive"](../deep-dives/deep-dives.html) pages that you will create. 

## Week 1 - Creating your first web page in GitHub ##

Developing content to go onto the web has evolved from a solitary effort to one where teams work together in developing components of larger web sites. These teams need to have a variety of tools to enable their work. Some of the most important tools enable code sharing with the team, and in projects based on the [Open Source](http://opensource.org/osd-annotated) software model the rest of the world. The [GitHub](https://github.com/) web platform uses the [Git](http://git-scm.com/) distributed [version control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control) system to enable sharing of code and hosting static web pages based on that shared code. 

We will be using GitHub as the platform for hosting your portfolios for the class, allowing you to learn how version control operates, and how to provide comments and keep notes on your work and the work of others (this will be part of our peer review process).

While the work we do this and next week will be directly through the editor integrated into the GitHub system, you will eventually want to install one of the recommended desktop applications that allow you to develop your web pages on your local computer and then update the files on the GitHub system when you want to create a new version. Also, you can't add things like images to your web pages until you are adding them to a local repository on your computer and then sending them to GitHub. 

### Create a GitHub Account and Public Repository for the Class ###

Step 1

:	Go to the [GitHub](https://github.com/) web site and sign up for an account by providing a username, email address and password and submitting the requested information by clicking the "Sign up for GitHub" button.

You will then be taken to the "Welcome to GitHub" page where you can see that you have signed up for a free GitHub account.

Step 2

:	Click the "Finish sign up" button near the bottom of the page. 

This takes you to your GitHub dashboard from which you can access all the information about your account. *Feel free to review the GitHub Bootcamp materials that are highlighted on your home page*.

Step 3

:	Click the "Create repository" button near the lower right corner of your dashboard.


Step 4

:	Fill out the information requested for the new repository and click the "Create repository" button near the bottom of the page.

Step 5

:	Create the first file in your repository - a "README" file by clicking on the "README" link provided just under the "Quick Setup" box. When you click this link you will be taken to the editor where you can edit the default README file and "commit" (save) the new/modified file. You will then be taken back to your repository's home page.

### Create Your First Web Page ###

Step 1

:	From your repository page (shown after completing Step 5 above), click on the "Create a new file here button"

Step 2

:	Add the information for the new page as shown in the following figure and click the "Commit New File" button to save your changes.

### Make Your New Web Page Visible to the World ###

Step 1

:	Create a new "Branch" from your "Master" branch called "gh-pages". This is a specially named branch of content that GitHub will make available through a specific web address as a web site instead of the standard GitHub interface. 

![Process for creating a new "gh-pages" branch from the default "master" branch. ](images/Github_08.png)


Step 2

:	Test to see if your new page is visible, and looks the way you expect by opening the web address for the page you have in your "gh-pages" branch. This web address is structured like this:

:	`http://<your GitHub username>.github.io/<your repository name>/<the HTML file name>`

:	For example: [http://geog12345.github.io/geog485/helloworld.html](http://geog12345.github.io/geog485/helloworld.html)
