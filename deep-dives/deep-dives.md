# Geography 485L/585L "Deep Dive" Assignments #

The four assignments that constitute the class's "Deep Dives" consist of a series of activities that build upon each other and the smaller assignments accomplished as ["Milestones"](../milestones/milestones.html) in the development of your course portfolio. These assignments will be added to your portfolio content and evaluated in conjunction with the mid-term and end-of-term portfolio assessment and grading. The approximate timing of these assignments is provided below, though may be subject to change as progress through the class material continues. 


## Week 4: Creation of a a Google Maps Web Page with Custom Points and Labels ##

In your milestone for Week 4 you built a styled Google Maps base map for a particular region of interest. For this *deep dive* assignment create a new free-standing web page that includes a brief description of the topical focus of your mapper:

* The type of information that you want to depict in your map
* Your reasons for selecting the specific area shown in the map
* A description of what you are trying to communicate with the map

Embed the base map that you initially created for your lab assignment into this new web page.

* Add 5 overlay objects to the map that relate to specific items of interest or importance. These overlay objects may be _markers_, _polylines_, or _polygons_. Make sure to include descriptive titles for each object.
* Add an _infobox_ to each object that contains additional detailed information about the object
