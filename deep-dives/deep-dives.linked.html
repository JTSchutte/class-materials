<p>The four assignments that constitute the class's &quot;Deep Dives&quot; consist of a series of activities that build upon each other and the smaller assignments accomplished as <a href="http://karlbenedict.com/GEOG485-585/milestones/milestones.html">&quot;Milestones&quot;</a> in the development of your course portfolio. These assignments will be added to your portfolio content and evaluated in conjunction with the mid-term and end-of-term portfolio assessment and grading. The approximate timing of these assignments is provided below, though may be subject to change as progress through the class material continues.</p>

<p>In your milestone for Week 4 you built a styled Google Maps base map for a particular region of interest. For this <em>deep dive</em> assignment create a new free-standing web page that includes a brief description of the topical focus of your mapper:</p>
<ul>
<li>The type of information that you want to depict in your map</li>
<li>Your reasons for selecting the specific area shown in the map</li>
<li>A description of what you are trying to communicate with the map</li>
</ul>
<p>Embed the base map that you initially created for your lab assignment into this new web page.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add 5 overlay objects to the map that relate to specific items of interest or importance. These overlay objects may be <em>markers</em>, <em>polylines</em>, or <em>polygons</em>. Make sure to include descriptive titles for each object.</li>
<li>Add an <em>infobox</em> to each object that contains additional detailed information about the object</li>
</ul>
