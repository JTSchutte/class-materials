# Geography 485L/585L Goals, Objectives and Readings #

Internet mapping technologies are an important component of geospatial data capture, sharing, visualization, and delivery. This course provides a survey of current and emerging internet and geospatial interoperability standards, technologies, and capabilities. The emphasis of the work in this class will be hands-on experience in four critical aspects of Internet-enabled mapping:

* The basic concepts behind web development and web mapping technologies that enable the delivery of maps and mapped data through web browsers

* The Open Standards that facilitate the exchange of map images and geospatial data over the internet

* The use of published standards-based services in desktop mapping applications that implement those standards

* The deployment of standards-based geospatial map and data services that other systems and users may make use of

The specific class objectives that relate to these activities and departmental curriculum objectives for undergraduate and graduate students in the Geography Department include the following:

* Students will understand the concepts geospatial data and service interoperability

* Students will be able to define the specific requirements of a particular analysis or project and identify the interoperability standards that are capable of meeting those requirements

* Students will be knowledgeable in the core technologies that they may use to produce their own internet-enabled mapping capabilities 

* Students will understand the strengths and limitations of current internet mapping technologies for generating cartographically effective map products. 

The weekly goals, objectives and reading assignments are outlined below



## Week 1 - Introductions, Course Outline and Introduction to Web and Internet Concepts ## {#week01}

This week we will review the content and structure for the course and spend some time getting to know each other. Following this we will spend some time setting up some of the tools that we will be using for the course in developing our portfolio of materials.

### Weekly Milestone - Creating Your GitLab Project and First Web Page###

This week's milestone is to set up your class *project* in GitLab so you can get started in creating your web portfolio that will be incrementally built over the course of the next sixteen weeks. As part of the process of getting all the parts and pieces into place you will create your first web page within your project.
