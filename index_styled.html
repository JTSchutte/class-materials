		<h1>My Geography 485L/585L Home Page</h1>
		<h2>About me </h2>
		<p>I am a senior in a dual degree program. I am studying Political Science and Geography with a minor in Philosophy. I am supposed to graduate in May.
		Besides school I am a bee keeper! I have my own bee removal business which is how I get all the bees for my hives. As of now I have around 40 hives that 
		are all rescued colonies. I rescue around 100 hives a year, but I can't keep them all so I give a lot of them away to other bee keepers.
		What I would like to do with my training from school is pursue a career within a governement agency using my GIS skills. 
		</p>
		<h2>Why I'm taking the course</h2>
		<p>I am taking this course to learn how to use maps on the internet. I have wanted to incorporate a map onto my own website in which I can track the locations
		of hives I have removed throughout each season. I would like an interactive map that I can number each removal that is re-hived and then I can link each
		one to updates of each removal. I think that people would be interested in seeing where the bees that came out of the home ended up, and follow their 
		progress. I also used to dabble with HTML, and I always wanted to learn more so that is another reason I am in this class.
