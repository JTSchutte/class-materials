# Geography 485L/585L Closing Comments and Next Steps #

### What We've Done ...###

* Developed basic web pages
* Learned how to publish our content using GitHub
* Developed basic interactive maps based on the Google Maps API and OpenLayers
* Learned about the key data visualization and data access standards from the Open Geospatial Consortium
	* WMS, WFS, WCS
* Used those visualization and data access services in desktop GIS applications
* Published data using those standards, and done basic styling of those data

Whew!!! That's a bunch of work for 16 weeks. Good Job. 

### Where Do You Go From Here? ###

* Establish your own identity on the internet by getting your own domain name (e.g. [Hover.com](https://www.hover.com/), [GoDaddy](http://www.godaddy.com/) and many others
* Build your personal web site focusing on what interests you (published through GitHub or any other web hosting provider)
* Continue experimenting with interactive mapping - using the Google Maps API, OpenLayers or another framework that interests you. Some additional candidates include:
	* The ArcGIS [Javascript API](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/)
	* [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) Javascript Framework
	* The new version of OpenLayers ([3.0](http://openlayers.org/)) when it eventually becomes available
* Publish your own data (you will need a server e.g. [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), [Cari.net](http://cari.net/), [MapServerPro](http://www.mapserverpro.com/cr-articles/mapserver_hosting.php), [AcuGIS](http://www.acugis.com/about-us.htm), [Geocortex](http://www.geocortex.com/arcgis-server-services/arcgis-server-hosting/)) using GeoServer or another platform like:
	* [MapServer](http://mapserver.org/)
	* [ArcGIS Server](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgisserver)
	* [ArcGIS Online](http://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/reference/arcgis-server-services.htm)
