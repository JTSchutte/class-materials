## Basics ##

### Outline ###

* What is Internet Mapping?

* Definitions

* Tools

### What is Internet Mapping ###

*Extended Desktop Mapping*

: 	Use of open standards based remote data and map services in desktop applications

*Geospatial Data Sharing*

:	Establishing open standards based services to share geospatial data and mapping capabilities over the Internet

*Web-client Mapping*

:	The delivery of mapping and geospatial data tools through web browsers, again based upon open standards

### Definitions ###

Internet

:	The global computer network of computers that typically connect with each other over TCP/IP

World Wide Web

:	The subset of applications that are run over the Internet, typically using the HTTP protocol in combination with data (HTML, XML, XHTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior (JavaScript) components

Mapping

:	The generation of cartographic products that include map images (pictures of geospatial data) and other elements (e.g. legends, tools, scale information, north-arrow)

### Definitions ###

Analysis

:	The development of models (statistical and otherwise) that enable the exploration of geospatial data and testing of hypotheses using those data

Open Standards

:	While the definition varies from one organization to the next, Open Standards are often characterized by the following:

* Developed through a public process by a national or international standards group
* May be implemented royalty-free

### Definitions ###

Interoperability

:	Ability of systems to share data and information with each other

COTS

:	Commercial Off-the-Shelf Software. Applications that are “purchased” from vendors, often with license terms that restrict the use the software to the specific platform for which it is licensed. Often comes with implicit or explicit technical support

Open Source

:	Software licensed under terms that are consistent with the Open Source definition, which includes access to source code, and freedom to modify and redistribute

### Definitions ###

Data

:	Actual values associated with geographic locations. For example - numeric elevation values associated with locations within a Digital Elevation Model.

Metadata

:	Data about a particular data product or service. Metadata provide critical documentation that supports the discovery and use of data products and data and mapping services


### Tools ###

Server Platform

:	Linux server with GeoServer, Apache, GDAL and Proj libraries

Operating System (one of the following)

:	Microsoft Windows Vista or 7 

:	Mac OS 10.6 or above

:	Linux (*speak to Dr. Benedict*)

Geographic Information System (GIS)

:	Quantum GIS (platform specific [download](http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Download))

:	ArcGIS 10 (*optional* - request free student version installation CD from Dr. Benedict - *Windows Only*)

### Tools ###

Geographic Data Processing/Analysis (one of the following)

:	FWTools (*Windows* & *Linux* - [free download](http://fwtools.maptools.org/))

:	GDAL and related frameworks (*Mac* - the current "GDAL Complete" convenience package  available [here](http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks))

Text Editor 

:	Notepad (*Windows* - included with operating system)

:	Notapad++ (*Windows* - [free download](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/))

:	TextEdit (*Mac* - included with operating system)

:	TextWrangler (*Mac* - [free download](http://www.barebones.com/products/TextWrangler/))

### Tools ###

Secure File Transfer Protocol Client

:	WinSCP (*Windows* - [free download](http://winscp.net/eng/index.php))

:	Fugu (*Mac* - [free download](http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/fugu/))

Secure Shell (SSH) Client

:	Chrome (*All Operating Systems* - [free download](http://www.google.com/chrome))

### Communication ###

This is the first iteration with the class as a hybrid course, so the most productive communication model will evolve over the semester, but I commit to the following:

* I will respond to email questions within ~24 hours

* I will share responses to common questions with the rest of the class through the online discussion board

I also *strongly* encourage that questions be submitted through the discussion board so that other students can both *learn from* and *contribute to* the answers provided.
